100 Days of Code Challenge Implementation: Days 1-10 - Setting the Foundation
Day 1: Setting Up My Development Environment

Objective: Prepare my workspace for the coding journey.
Steps:

Install Necessary Software:

Text Editor/IDE: I install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my code editor.
Programming Languages: I install interpreters/compilers for the languages I'll be using (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.).
Command-Line Tools: I ensure my terminal or command prompt is configured with tools like Git, Node.js, Python, etc.
Package Managers: I install package managers like npm (for Node.js), pip (for Python), or others relevant to my tech stack.
Set Up Version Control:

Install Git: I make sure Git is installed on my machine.
Create a GitHub Account: If I donâ€™t have one, I sign up for GitHub.
Configure Git: I set up my global username and email in Git.
Create a Repository: I create a new repository on GitHub to track my progress and clone it to my local machine.
Version Control Practice: I make my first commit and push it to GitHub.
Optional (But Recommended):

Environment Configuration: I set up virtual environments (e.g., venv for Python) to manage dependencies.
Dotfiles: If I'm familiar, I set up dotfiles for custom configurations.
Browser Extensions: I install helpful extensions like React Developer Tools, Redux DevTools, or any others that assist with development.
Snippets/Shortcuts: I set up code snippets or shortcuts in VS Code for common tasks
